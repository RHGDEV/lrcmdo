# lrcmdo
This is a modified version of [discord.js-commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando)

Using this package __will__ make your bot act like mine so I wouldn't suggest using it for your work.

# Fork Information / Plans
- Remove unused stuff
- Add custom functions and support async/await in missing areas
- Extend the guild and message to support more defaults/frequently used settings
